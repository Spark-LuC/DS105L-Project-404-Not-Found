<Apart from the headers, this document is a template. Remove everything that is within brackets and replace with actual information.>

**Team Name:** <Team Name>

## Team Members

* Yan Zhou Terry (BSc Politics and Data Science | <2025>)
* Chengchao Lu Spark (BSc Politics and Data Science | <2025)
* Litong Zhong Annabel (BSc Politics and Data Science | <2025>)

## Brief Description of the Project

<Describe the project in a few sentences>

## Data Sources

We plan to use the following data sources:

* BBC : https://www.bbc.co.uk/
* Basketball Reference : https://www.basketball-reference.com/
* NBA : https://www.nba.com/
* Facebook : https://graph.facebook.com/

    
## Communication

Our group will use the following communication channels:

* GitHub   : GitHub is used as a platform for sharing and updating our code and data, as well as improving their quality collaboratively. 
* WhatsApp : WhatsApp is used as a tool for discussing ideas or inspirations related to the topic, issues regarding coding and data analysis. It is also used for delegating tasks and responsibilities, preparing PowerPoint, presentations. 
* WeChat   : Similar to WhatsApp.
* Slack    : Slack is used as a platform to discuss more technical issues that we find challenging. We also reach out to teachers and fellows for hints and advice to improve ideas and structure of the project. 

## Meetings

We will meet with the following frequency:

- In general three times per week at campus, the exact time depends on individual availability.
* <Every Tuesday after 11:00> : Discussing the main task of the project for the week and making the focus clear. Aggregating ideas and setting deadline for completing the tasks and sharing any resources that may require additional interpretation. 
* <Every Thursday after 11:00> : Updating progress of assigned tasks. Solving challenging issues together to ensure that the project remains on track and that everyone has the support they need to complete their tasks 
* <Every Friday after 16:00> : Overviewing progress to ensure that we have not missed any parts that we wish to include. May brainstorm new ideas to make the project better and work on it over the weekend.


## Work Distribution

We will distribute the work as shown in the following table:

**Legend:**

* **Data Collection**: Writing code to gather data from the web, APIs, etc.
* **Data Cleaning**: Writing code to clean the data, e.g. removing duplicates, removing outliers, etc.
* **Code Quality Check**: Ensuring that the code is well written, e.g. efficient use of pandas/tidyverse, not a lot of repetition, good variable names, etc.
* **Data Visualization**: Writing code to visualise the data, e.g. creating a histogram, scatter plot, etc.
* **Report**: Writing the report, e.g. the README.md file, the Jupyter Notebook, etc.

## Enforcing the Contract

If a team member does not fulfil their obligations, the following steps will be taken:

- Communicate via e-mail to [Jon](mailto:J.Cardoso-Silva@lse.ac.uk) and [Mustafa](mailto:m.c.ozkan@lse.ac.uk), explaining the situation and which aspects of the work distribution will be affected.
- Jon and Mustafa will try to resolve the issue by talking to the team member. 
    - If the team member does not respond in time, they might be penalised.
    - If the team member does not respond at all, they might will receive a 0 in the relevant group assignment(s).
- The team will have to re-distribute the work and a new Team Contract will have to be written and "signed" by all (remaining) team members.

Note that the assessment of the team members' performance will be based on the deliverables (presentation or final project code and website), not on the individual contributions. Even if a team member does not fulfil their obligations, the team will still be assessed as a whole. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the team members are all working together, that the work is well distributed and that contingency plans are in place in case a team member is not able to fulfil their obligations.

**What counts as a breach of the contract?**

- Not attending meetings without a good reason
- Not fulfilling their obligations as outlined in the table above
- Not communicating with the team without a good reason

## Signing the Contract

By submitting a copy of this document to Moodle, the team members agree to the terms of this contract.
